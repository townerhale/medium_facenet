This project used Tensorflow, Dlib, and Scikit-learn to create a facial recognition pipeline. The steps taken were: 1) Preprocessing the Images using Facial Detention and Alignment code that was published by MIT. 2) Generating Facial Embeddings in Tensorflow. 3) Training an SVM Classifier on the data set.
